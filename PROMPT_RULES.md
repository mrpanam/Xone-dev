# Code Contribution Guidelines

## Core Principles

- Follow established best practices and prefer readability over cleverness.
- When unsure about syntax, API usage, or library behavior, consult the official documentation first and provide references when possible.
- Only modify what is necessaryâ€”avoid rewriting existing code unless required.
- Maintain well-structured, self-explanatory, and consistent functions and files.
- Always aim for production-quality, clean code with minimal friction.

## Code Style

- Use clear and descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Document complex logic with clear comments
- Follow the existing code style and formatting of the project

## Best Practices

- Write tests for new functionality
- Handle errors explicitly
- Keep dependencies to a minimum
- Optimize for maintainability first, then performance if needed

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused and small when possible
- Include clear descriptions of changes
- Reference related issues or tickets
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting for review
